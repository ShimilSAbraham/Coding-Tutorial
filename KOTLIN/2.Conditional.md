### Code 3:
```
fun main()
{
  val a: Int = 5
  val b: Int = 10
  if(a>b)
  {
    println(a)
  }
  else
  {
    println(b)
  }
}
```
* _prints 10_

### Code 4: 
#### (Short version of Code 3)
```
fun main()
{
   val a: Int = 5
   val b: Int = 10
   val c: Int = if(a>b) a else b
   println(c)
}
```
* _prints 10_

### Code 5:
#### (when statements - alternative of switch)
```
fun main()
{
   val a: Int = 5
   when(a)
   {
     5 -> println("Hello")
     2 -> println("Bye")
     else -> println("Wrong Input")
   }
}
```
* _prints **Hello**_
* _if a was 2, it would print **Bye**_
* _if a was any value other than 2 and 5, it would print **Wrong Input**_
* _instead of writing case 5(as in switch), we directly write the value and an arrow to what it should do_
* _and instead of default, we have an "else"_
