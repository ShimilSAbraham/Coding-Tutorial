### Code 1:


> fun main()  
> {
>>  println("Hello World")
> }

_just like most of the languages there is a main function_
_fun is a keyword used to create function_

### Code 2:

>fun main()
>{
>>  val name = "World"
>>  println("Hello "+name)
>}


_prints Hello World_
_can also print the same using 'println("Hello $name")'
_val is an immutable variable more like constant in other langauges 
_var is used to define mutable variables 
_to make the code readable it is good to write the datatype along with definition 
_' var name = "World" ' can be written as ' var name: String = "World" '
